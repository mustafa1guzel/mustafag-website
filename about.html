    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I'm Mustafa Güzel, a high school student at Robert College (Class of 2027), passionate about mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. I’ve actively participated in academic research, competitions, and summer programs in these fields.</p>

    <p>I currently serve as a student leader in the AI4RC Club and the Blockchain Club. In addition, I have recently taken on a leadership role in the Make Learning Better (MLB) Club, a group focused on researching the factors that impact students' learning experiences within our school environment.</p>

    <p>My long-term goal is to develop and contribute to technologies that reduce global energy consumption by leveraging emerging computational approaches such as artificial intelligence, biological computing, and quantum computing. I aspire to help build sustainable, scalable systems that prioritize both performance and environmental impact.</p>
